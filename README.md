### Debug Mode

You can run this application in debug mode to help you to understand what's going on the details. Just pass the `#debug` hash-fragment on URL when you open `snake.html` on the browser, eg:

```
file:///(...)/jssnake/snake.html#debug
```

As you can see, each fragment of the Snake will have their identification and the same happens with the food as well. The "tiles"(red and green) are the tilesets of the "map/board" where the Snake will be abble to moviment through, and where the food will appear when needed. ÃŸ
Note that each tile is basically disposed in a X/Y coordinates in a Coordinate(Cartesian) Plane. For example, the tileset number `3` is on `X = 3 | Y = 0`, the tileset `12` is on `X = 2 | Y = 5`
